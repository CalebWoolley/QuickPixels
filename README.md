# QuickPixels
This is a simple and small class that allows for quick processing and manipulation of image data.

With it, you can go through an image's pixel data much faster than using the BitMap.GetPixel function.  You can typically expect a speed increase of up to 10 times as fast with this small utility!  It's very easy to use.
